synDirectory (Simple yet nifty)
Author: Ólafur Waage
Email: olafurw@gmail.com

This is a collection of php files (with images included) that enable
you to display contents of a directory.

It has added features like turning on and off displays for things like
directories, files, file extensions and more.

You can also select what filetypes you want only to see within your directory.

It has some support for skinning (with css class names for most elements)

And the index file is small (only 4 lines of actual code), so its very easy to
have the index file generated on the fly

There is also support for translation via the config.php file.

If you have any questions, hit me up on my email.

If you want further info on what has changed, check out the Changelog here below.
